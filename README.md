# Cheaclo

It's a project, which is a topic of my Bachelor Thesis. Cheaclo is a web application, which aggregates discounts from online clothes shops. It is build on architecture of microservices, hence we have 6 of them:

 - [Cloud Gateway](https://github.com/cheaclo/cloud-gateway)

 - [Service Registry](https://github.com/cheaclo/service-registery)

 - [Web Scraper](https://github.com/cheaclo/web-scrapper)

 - [Users Database](https://github.com/cheaclo/users-database)

 - [Clothes Database](https://github.com/cheaclo/clothes-database)

 - [Client Front](https://github.com/cheaclo/client-front)

For more details navigate to specific microservice.
